CSync is a versatile and powerful Minecraft plugin designed to enhance server management by integrating Minecraft with Discord. The plugin enables seamless verification of users, sending automated messages to Discord channels, and offers flexible configuration options to suit various server needs.

The main functionality of this plugin is to allow you to grab a verification code from a website with a discord ID, and cross it with the command /verify (verification code) and then it can pastes messages to a discord channel using a discord webhook. Everything is customizable and open source!
